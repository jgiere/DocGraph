# Introduction

DocGraph is a small program to highlight similarities between documents (PDFs, Word documents, E-Books).
It uses the TF-IDF algorithm to calculate the similarity between all documents and plots the data in a graph.

The program uses Maven and JavaFx and requires a Apache Solr Cloud configuration to index and query data.


# Installation
Unfortunately, we currently do not provide compiled binaries. Nevertheless, you can clone this repository and compile it on your own. DocGraph uses Maven, which makes in quiet easy to compile.

Additionally, a documentation is provided as a PDF file. The documentation is in German, but a translated version will be available soon.
